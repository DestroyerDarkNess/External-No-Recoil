# External-No-Recoil
No Recoil, External for FPS Games.

Activation and Deactivation: F2

A Completely External No Recoil. No hookea, Basically only Imports to Functions are used (GetCursorPos, SetCursorPos, GetAsyncKeyState, mouse_event).

Without manipulating / editing game memory. It works more like a macro.
It only works with the mause, this makes it INDETECTABLE and universal for any FPS game, so far I have only tried it on:
Operation 7 Sofnix and Counter Striker 1.6.

It stands out with games that have a lot of recoil. Example: Operation7.

Unique use of the windows API "user32.dll".

    +Log system.
    +Save Settings.
    +Fast and Async.
    +Active Window Monitor.
